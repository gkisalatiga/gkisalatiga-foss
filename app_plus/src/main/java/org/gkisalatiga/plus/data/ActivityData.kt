/**
 * This is the activity-wide data transmitted between screens and composables.
 * ---
 * Since Jetpack Compose (this project) has only one activity, we must seek a way to transmit
 * app context, coroutine, etc. across screens.
 * It can usually be done by utilizing [androidx.compose.ui.platform.LocalContext].
 * However, we found that using data class like this gets rid of having to declare
 * and assign variables at the beginning of a composable function to get the current
 * app's local context.
 * ---
 * This implementation prevents StaticMemoryLeak caused by storing app context statically
 * as a global variable.
 * See: https://github.com/gkisalatiga/gkisalatiga-foss/commit/e5d0386dd52519d27e187c523e475d6424947322
